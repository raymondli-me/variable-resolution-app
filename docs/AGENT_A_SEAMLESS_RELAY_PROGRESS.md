**Agent:** Claude Implementation Agent A (Backend Specialist)
**Date:** October 6, 2025
**Status:** üîÑ IN PROGRESS - Seamless Relay Active
**Previous Agent:** Agent B (Frontend Specialist)

## Relay Context

Picked up from Agent B's fixes:
- ‚úÖ API namespace typos fixed (window.api.db ‚Üí window.api.database)
- ‚úÖ Return format mismatches fixed (removed .success/.data wrappers)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Identified backend database schema bug for Agent A

---

## Fixes Completed This Session

### 1. Database Schema Bug - item_count Column ‚úÖ

**Issue:** `SQLITE_ERROR: no such column: item_count`
**Impact:** Drag-and-drop collections to folders crashed
**Location:** `src/database/folder-methods.js:239`

**Root Cause:**
```javascript
// OLD - queried non-existent column:
SELECT SUM(item_count) as total FROM collections
WHERE folder_id = ? AND archived = 0
```

**Solution:**
```javascript
// NEW - calculate from existing columns:
SELECT
  COALESCE(SUM(video_count), 0) +
  COALESCE(SUM(comment_count), 0) as total
FROM collections
WHERE folder_id = ? AND archived = 0
```

**Result:** Drag-and-drop now works without errors

**Commit:** 2613412

## Current Work: PDF Viewing Improvements

### User Requirements:
1. Collections work for videos/comments but **NOT for PDFs**
2. Can't see PDF information at all in collection viewer
3. Window is too narrow, needs to be wider/responsive

### Investigation:
- `collection-viewer.js` only shows videos and comments
- No PDF rendering capability exists
- Available APIs identified:
  - `window.api.pdf.list(collectionId)` - get PDFs for collection
  - `window.api.pdf.getExcerpts(pdfId)` - get excerpts for a PDF
  - `window.api.database.getMergePDFExcerpts(mergeId)` - for merged collections

### Plan:
1. Add PDF list rendering to collection viewer
2. Add PDF excerpt viewing when PDF selected
3. Make viewer window wider (CSS changes)
4. Ensure responsive layout

**Status:** In progress (context limit approaching, will complete in next session)

## Handoff Notes for Next Agent

**If continuing PDF work:**
- `collection-viewer.js` needs PDF tab/section added
- Backend APIs are ready: `window.api.pdf.list()` and `getExcerpts()`
- Modal CSS needs width adjustment (currently too narrow)
- Consider tabbed interface: Videos | PDFs | Comments

**Outstanding Issues:**
- None blocking - all high-priority bugs fixed
- PDF viewing is enhancement, not critical bug

---

**Status:** Ready for relay handoff or continuation
