## Part I: An Honest Assessment of the Current State

This document serves as the definitive summary of our current session. While we have made monumental architectural progress, our final verification testing has revealed several critical regressions. **The application is currently in a broken, unstable state.**

This situation is the result of a failure in our process and an oversight on my part as the consultant. I pushed for rapid, large-scale refactoring without ensuring all legacy components were either updated or disabled, leading to the current instability. This report outlines a clear plan to recover.

### The Good: The Foundation is Strong

We have successfully achieved our major architectural goals:
-   The backend is **decomposed** into clean, modular services.
-   The core services are **modernized** into robust classes.
-   The UI has been **unified** around our "Collections-First" vision.

### The Bad: The Critical Bugs

Your manual testing uncovered two major, blocking bugs:

1.  **The "Ghost UI" Bug:** The error `TypeError: Cannot set properties of null` in `bws-manager.js` is happening because this old script, which runs on startup, is trying to access HTML elements from the old BWS tab that we have already deleted. It's a dangling reference.

2.  **The "Schema Mismatch" Bug:** The error `SQLITE_ERROR: table videos has no column named video_id` proves that the new "Filter" action is using an incorrect database query. The code is referencing a column name that does not exist in our current schema.

### The Ugly: The Root Cause

We have performed a "partial demolition." We tore down the old UI walls but left some of the old electrical wiring live. This legacy JavaScript is now causing crashes because it is disconnected from its original context.

## Part II: The Recovery Plan - Stabilize, then Advance

When we resume, our **sole priority** will be to get the application back to a **100% stable, error-free state.** No new features will be considered until this "Hardening Sprint" is complete.

### Task 1 (for next agent): Fix the Ghost UI Bug

-   **Goal:** Decouple all legacy JavaScript from the old, deleted UI.
-   **Action:** Review all scripts that run on startup (`renderer-advanced.js`, `bws-manager.js`, etc.). Find every `document.getElementById` or `document.querySelector` call that references an ID from the old, deleted tabs. You must either:
    a) **Completely remove** the legacy script if it's no longer needed.
    b) **Wrap the code** in defensive `if (element) { ... }` blocks to ensure it no longer causes errors on startup.

### Task 2 (for next agent): Fix the Schema Mismatch Bug

-   **Goal:** Fix the broken database query in the "Filter" action.
-   **Action:** Find the `collections:filter` handler in our IPC code. Locate the SQL query that is failing. You must correct the query to use the proper column name for the video's primary key (likely `id` or `v.id`, not `video_id`).

### Task 3 (for QA & Testing Agent): Enhance the E2E Test

-   **Goal:** Make our E2E test capable of catching these kinds of bugs automatically.
-   **Action:** The `tests/e2e/full-pipeline.spec.js` script must be enhanced. It needs to be modified to use a **pre-populated database fixture** so it can test actions on existing data. Furthermore, it must be updated to **fail if any critical console errors are detected** during the run.

## Part III: A Pledge for the Future

This has been a challenging but invaluable learning experience. It has exposed the final weakness in our process, which we will now fix.

**My Commitment:** As the consultant, I will ensure that all future handoffs include a mandatory, comprehensive regression test step. We will not mark a task complete until our `test:e2e` script passes with **zero regressions and zero critical console errors.**

Enjoy the break. When we return, we will execute this recovery plan, restore the application to a state of quality, and then we can truly and confidently build upon the excellent foundation we have created.
