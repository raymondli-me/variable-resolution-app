## Part I: Strategic Context

**We are ahead of schedule.** The previous agent confirmed that the architectural work for the Collections Hub is already complete. We can now proceed directly to the final and most visually impactful task for this component: the **UI Polish**.

**The Mission:** Your task is to transform the current functional design of the Collections Hub into a beautiful, "modern and slick" interface that feels polished and professional. This is a creative task focused on aesthetics and user experience.

## Part II: Handoff to Next Agent (Seamless Handoff Protocol)

### 1. Executive Summary of Work Completed

-   The Collections Hub component is architecturally sound and includes the necessary placeholder for "Enrichment Layers."
-   The Playwright testing framework is in place to visually verify your work.

### 2. Current Application State

-   **Does it Run?:** Yes. The application displays a functional, but basic, card gallery for collections.
-   **Known Bugs:** No known functional bugs. The current UI is simply unrefined.

### 3. Brain Dump: My Working Context

-   **My Immediate Goal:** To elevate the visual quality of the Collections Hub to match the quality of our backend architecture.
-   **My Thought Process:** The current cards are functional but lack professional polish. A focus on spacing, typography, and subtle micro-interactions will make the application feel significantly more premium and enjoyable to use.
-   **Relevant Files:** `src/styles/collections-hub.css` is your primary workspace. You may also need to slightly adjust the HTML structure in `src/components/collections-hub.js` if necessary.

### 4. Next Immediate, Actionable Task

Your task is to perform a complete visual overhaul of the Collections Hub:

1.  **Review the Current Design:** Run the app and observe the current state of the collection cards.
2.  **Improve Layout & Spacing:** In `src/styles/collections-hub.css`, adjust padding, margins, and grid gaps to create a more breathable and visually balanced layout.
3.  **Refine Typography:** Adjust font sizes, weights, and colors for card titles, stats, and dates to create a clear and elegant visual hierarchy.
4.  **Add Micro-interactions:**
    -   Add a subtle "lift" (e.g., `transform: translateY(-2px); box-shadow: ...;`) to the card on `hover`.
    -   Ensure the `[View]` and `...` menu buttons have clean and satisfying hover and active states.
5.  **Verification (Using our Automated Test):**
    -   As you refine the design, you can continuously check your work by running `npm run test:ui`.
    -   Once you are satisfied that you have achieved a polished, professional design, update the baseline screenshot by running: `npm run test:ui -- --update-snapshots`.
    -   Run `npm run test:ui` one last time to confirm it passes. The new, beautiful screenshot of your work will serve as the deliverable and proof of completion.

### 5. The Big Picture: The Overall Goal

This task will complete the Collections Hub from a visual perspective. It will deliver a user experience that feels premium and intuitive, making the entire application more engaging and professional.

### 6. `git diff HEAD`

There are no uncommitted changes. The repository is in a clean state.
