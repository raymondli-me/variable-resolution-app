# Handoff: Kickoff Phase 2 - Implement Collection Lineage

**Date:** October 7, 2025
**Author:** Gemini Consultant Agent
**Status:** ðŸŸ¢ **ACTION REQUIRED** - Handoff to Implementation Agent

## Part I: Strategic Context

**Welcome to Phase 2: The Enrichment Pipeline.** The previous session successfully concluded our major refactoring effort, leaving us with a stable, modern codebase.

We now begin building our core analysis features. The first and most critical step is to update our database schema to support **derived collections**. This will enable us to track the lineage of our analyses, which is the central goal of this new phase. The full strategic plan is in `docs/BLUEPRINT_PHASE_2_ENRICHMENT_PIPELINE.md`.

## Part II: Handoff to Agent (Seamless Handoff Protocol)

### 1. Executive Summary of Work Completed

-   The previous session concluded with the creation of the strategic blueprint for Phase 2.
-   The codebase is stable and ready for new feature development.

### 2. Current Application State

-   **Does it Run?:** Yes.
-   **Known Bugs:** No known functional bugs.

### 3. Brain Dump: My Working Context

-   **My Immediate Goal:** To begin Step 1 of the new blueprint: implementing the database schema changes for collection lineage.
-   **My Thought Process:** Before any service can create a "derived collection," the `collections` table must support the concept of lineage. This requires adding a `parent_collection_id` to link a collection to its source, and a `derivation_info` field to store the details of the operation (e.g., 'filtered with score > 0.8'). This database change is the critical first step.
-   **Relevant Files:** `src/database/db.js` (for schema reference) and a new script you will create in the `scripts/` directory.

### 4. Next Immediate, Actionable Task

Your task is to implement the database schema changes required for derived collections:

1.  **Create Migration Script:** Create a new file: `scripts/add-lineage-to-collections.js`.
2.  **Implement Migration:** In this script, write the necessary `db.run('ALTER TABLE collections ADD COLUMN ...')` commands to add two new columns to the `collections` table:
    -   `parent_collection_id` (INTEGER, with a `REFERENCES collections(id)`)
    -   `derivation_info` (TEXT)
3.  **Add NPM Script:** In `package.json`, add a new script to run this migration, e.g., `"migrate:lineage": "node scripts/add-lineage-to-collections.js"`.
4.  **Run the Migration:** Execute your new script from the command line: `npm run migrate:lineage`.
5.  **Verification:** Use a database client or a simple script to inspect the `collections` table and verify that the two new columns (`parent_collection_id` and `derivation_info`) now exist.

### 5. The Big Picture: The Overall Goal

This database change is the foundational requirement for our entire Enrichment Pipeline. Once this is in place, we can begin updating our services to create and link derived collections, bringing our core architectural vision to life.

### 6. `git diff HEAD`

There are no uncommitted changes. The repository is in a clean state.
