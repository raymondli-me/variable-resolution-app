# Handoff: Build the Collection Card Gallery

**Date:** October 7, 2025
**Author:** Gemini Consultant Agent
**Status:** ðŸŸ¢ **ACTION REQUIRED** - Handoff to Next Agent

---

## Part I: Strategic Context

**The Canvas is Ready.** The previous agent successfully cleared the UI by deprecating the old navigation tabs and creating the placeholder `collections-hub.js` component.

**The Next Mission:** Your task is to bring our "Collections-First" vision to life. You will transform the empty Collections Hub into a dynamic, modern, card-style gallery that displays all user collections.

## Part II: Handoff to Next Agent (Seamless Handoff Protocol)

### 1. Executive Summary of Work Completed

-   The old "YouTube" and "PDF" tabs have been removed.
-   The `collections-hub.js` component is now the primary view.

### 2. Current Application State

-   **Does it Run?:** Yes. The application is stable and shows a "Welcome" message in the main view.
-   **Known Bugs:** No known functional bugs.

### 3. Brain Dump: My Working Context

-   **My Immediate Goal:** To build the core visual layout of the new Collections Hub.
-   **My Thought Process:** The hub should fetch all collections from the database and render each one as a distinct "card." This provides an at-a-glance overview of all user projects and serves as the entry point for all future actions (viewing, rating, etc.). The focus of this task is on the visual layout and dynamic rendering; the actions on the cards can be stubbed for now.
-   **Relevant Files:** `src/components/collections-hub.js`, `index-advanced.html` (to add a new CSS file).

### 4. Next Immediate, Actionable Task

Your task is to build the initial version of the card-based Collection Gallery:

1.  **Fetch Data:** In `src/components/collections-hub.js`, use the existing `window.api.database.getCollections()` function to fetch all collections when the component loads.
2.  **Create Card Layout:** For each collection returned, dynamically generate an HTML "card" element inside the `#collections-hub-container`.
3.  **Card Design:** Each card must be styled to be clean and modern. It must display:
    -   The Collection Name.
    -   A **Genre Icon** (e.g., a ðŸ“¹ for YouTube, ðŸ“„ for PDF). You will need to inspect the `collection.settings` to determine the type.
    -   Key stats (e.g., "25 Videos" or "1,204 Excerpts").
    -   The creation date.
    -   A primary `[View]` button.
    -   A `...` context menu button.
4.  **Styling:** Create a new CSS file at `src/styles/collections-hub.css` and link it in `index-advanced.html`. Use Flexbox or CSS Grid to create a responsive grid of cards.
5.  **Stub Functionality:** The buttons do not need to be fully functional yet. When a `[View]` or `...` button is clicked, it should simply `console.log` the ID of the collection it belongs to.
6.  **Verification:** Run the app. The "Collections" view should now display a grid of cards, one for each collection in your database, instead of the old welcome message.

### 5. The Big Picture: The Overall Goal

This task creates the core visual foundation of our new, unified application. It will be the first time the "Collections-First" architecture becomes truly visible to the user, making it a critical step in our Phase 1 plan.

### 6. `git diff HEAD`

There are no uncommitted changes. The repository is in a clean state.
