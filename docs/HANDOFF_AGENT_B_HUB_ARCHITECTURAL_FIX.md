# Handoff: Architecturally Align the Collections Hub

**Date:** October 7, 2025
**Author:** Gemini Consultant Agent
**Status:** ðŸŸ¢ **ACTION REQUIRED** - Handoff to Next Agent

---

## Part I: Strategic Context

**Tooling is Complete:** The previous agent successfully established our Playwright testing framework. We can now automatically launch the app and take screenshots to verify UI changes. This unblocks our UI development.

**The Next Mission:** Your task is to resume work on the Collections Hub. Before we make it look pretty, we must make it architecturally correct. You will refactor the Collection Card component to support the display of "Enrichment Layers," a core requirement of our "Collections-First" vision.

## Part II: Handoff to Next Agent (Seamless Handoff Protocol)

### 1. Executive Summary of Work Completed

-   The Playwright testing framework is installed and configured.
-   A smoke test exists at `tests/ui/smoke-test.spec.js` which can launch the app and take a screenshot.
-   The last commit was `c529154`.

### 2. Current Application State

-   **Does it Run?:** Yes.
-   **Known Bugs:** The Collections Hub UI is functionally incomplete and does not have a place to display analysis results (Enrichments).

### 3. Brain Dump: My Working Context

-   **My Immediate Goal:** To modify the Collection Card component so that its data model and HTML structure have a designated place for future content.
-   **My Thought Process:** The current card shows basic collection info. It needs a new section where we *will* eventually list the Rating Projects and BWS Experiments associated with that collection. For this task, we will simply add a placeholder for that section.
-   **Relevant Files:** `src/components/collections-hub.js`.

### 4. Next Immediate, Actionable Task

Your task is to make the Collection Card component architecturally correct:

1.  **Modify the Component:** In `src/components/collections-hub.js`, locate the `render` method where the card HTML is generated.
2.  **Add the Enrichment Section:** Add a new `div` to the card's structure, below the main body but inside the card. This `div` will be for "Enrichment Layers."
3.  **Add Placeholder Content:** Inside this new section, add a simple placeholder to indicate its purpose. For example, a small footer element:
    ```html
    <div class="card-enrichments">
      <span>Enrichments: 0</span>
    </div>
    ```
4.  **Verification (Using our new tool!):**
    -   First, run the UI test suite: `npm run test:ui`. It should pass, as you haven't changed anything yet.
    -   Now, make your code changes.
    -   Run `npm run test:ui` again. **It is expected to fail.** The test will generate a new screenshot showing your "Enrichments: 0" text and notice that it doesn't match the baseline.
    -   To approve this intentional change, update the baseline screenshot by running: `npm run test:ui -- --update-snapshots`.
    -   Run `npm run test:ui` one last time. It should now pass. This successful test run is your proof that the work is complete and visually correct.

### 5. The Big Picture: The Overall Goal

This task ensures our central UI component is correctly structured before we invest time in polishing its appearance. By using our new testing framework to verify the change, you are also pioneering the agent-driven QA process that will define our workflow from now on.

### 6. `git diff HEAD`

There are no uncommitted changes. The repository is in a clean state.
