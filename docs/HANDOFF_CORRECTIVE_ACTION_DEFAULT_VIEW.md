# Handoff: CORRECTIVE ACTION - Set Default View

**Date:** October 7, 2025
**Author:** Gemini Consultant Agent
**Status:** ðŸ”´ **URGENT & BLOCKING** - Handoff to Next Agent

---

## Part I: Strategic Context

**The Problem:** The previous agent failed to correctly set the new Collections Hub as the application's default view. The app still incorrectly loads the old YouTube page on startup. This is a **blocking bug** that must be fixed before any other work continues.

**The Silver Lining:** The previous agent successfully built a new, comprehensive UI test suite (`tests/ui/comprehensive-views.spec.js`). You will use this new tool to verify your fix.

## Part II: Handoff to Next Agent (Seamless Handoff Protocol)

### 1. Executive Summary of Work Completed

-   A new, powerful Playwright test suite was created.
-   The previous agent attempted to set the default view but failed.

### 2. Current Application State

-   **Does it Run?:** Yes.
-   **Known Bugs:** The application does not load the correct view on startup, defaulting to the old YouTube page instead of the new Collections Hub.

### 3. Brain Dump: My Working Context

-   **My Immediate Goal:** To fix the application's startup sequence so the Collections Hub is the first thing the user sees.
-   **My Thought Process:** The previous agent used an incorrect CSS hack (`display: none`) which did not work. The correct solution is to modify the `active` classes on the view containers in `index-advanced.html` and ensure no JavaScript in `renderer-advanced.js` is overriding this on startup.
-   **Relevant Files:** `index-advanced.html`, `renderer-advanced.js`.

### 4. Next Immediate, Actionable Task

Your task is to correctly set the default view:

1.  **Remove the Incorrect Code:** In `index-advanced.html`, find and **delete** the `<div style="display: none;">` wrappers that the previous agent added around the old views. They are incorrect and unnecessary.
2.  **Set the Active View:** In `index-advanced.html`, find the main view containers. **Remove the `active` class** from `<div id="youtubeView" class="view active">`.
3.  **Add the `active` class** to the correct container: `<div id="collectionsView" class="view">` should become `<div id="collectionsView" class="view active">`.
4.  **Verify No Overrides:** Briefly review `renderer-advanced.js` to ensure there are no `showView('youtube')` calls being made on application startup that would override your HTML change.
5.  **Verification (Using the New Tool):**
    -   Run the comprehensive UI test suite: `npm run test:ui`.
    -   The test named "01-collections-hub.png" will likely fail because the screenshot will change.
    -   This is **expected**. Update the baseline screenshot by running: `npm run test:ui -- --update-snapshots`.
    -   Run `npm run test:ui` one last time. **It must pass.** The new screenshot in `test-results/` must now show the Collections Hub. This is the proof that the bug is fixed.

### 5. The Big Picture: The Overall Goal

This corrective action unblocks our entire UI development track. By fixing this and verifying it with our new automated test, you are cementing a more robust and reliable development process for the entire team.

### 6. `git diff HEAD`

There are uncommitted changes from the previous agent. You should review them, but your primary focus is on the files and tasks listed above to fix the default view.
