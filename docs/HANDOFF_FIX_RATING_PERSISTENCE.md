# Handoff: Fix Rating Persistence & Counter Display

**Date:** October 7, 2025
**Author:** Gemini Consultant Agent
**Status:** ðŸ”´ **URGENT & BLOCKING** - Handoff to Next Agent

---

## Part I: Strategic Context

**Critical Bug Identified:** The core functionality of our "Co-Pilot" rating systemâ€”the persistence of human and AI ratings across sessions and correct display of progress countersâ€”is currently broken. This is a **critical bug** that renders the rating system unusable.

**The Mission:** Your task is to fix this rating persistence bug. All other work is on hold until this is resolved.

## Part II: Handoff to Agent (Seamless Handoff Protocol)

### 1. Executive Summary of Work Completed

-   The previous agent implemented the "Co-Pilot" rating UI, including human input and AI display.
-   AI re-rating and history features were added.
-   The agent also attempted to fix progress counters and AI rating persistence, but these issues are still present.

### 2. Current Application State

-   **Does it Run?:** Yes.
-   **Known Bugs:** Human and AI ratings are not persisting across app restarts or navigation. Progress counters are stuck at 0/Total.

### 3. Brain Dump: My Working Context

-   **My Immediate Goal:** To ensure human and AI ratings are correctly loaded from the database and displayed, and that progress counters reflect the actual rated items.
-   **My Thought Process:** The AI ratings are being saved, but the `loadHumanRating` and `loadAIRating` methods (or their equivalents) are not correctly retrieving the data from the database and updating the UI. The `updateRatingProgress` method is also not correctly querying the database for the counts.
-   **Relevant Files:** `src/components/pdf-excerpt-viewer.js` (for UI logic), `src/database/db.js` (for database access methods), `src/ipc/pdf-handlers.js` (for IPC handlers).

### 4. Next Immediate, Actionable Task

Your task is to fix the rating persistence and counter display:

1.  **Fix Human Rating Persistence:**
    -   In `src/components/pdf-excerpt-viewer.js`, debug the `loadHumanRating` method. Ensure it correctly calls `window.api.pdf.getExcerptRating` to retrieve the human rating from the database and then updates the UI (score buttons, notes textarea).
2.  **Fix AI Rating Persistence:**
    -   In `src/components/pdf-excerpt-viewer.js`, debug the `loadAIRating` method (or the logic that displays AI ratings). Ensure it correctly calls `window.api.pdf.getAIExcerptRating` to retrieve the latest AI rating from the database and then updates the AI Co-Pilot display.
3.  **Fix Progress Counters:**
    -   In `src/components/pdf-excerpt-viewer.js`, debug the `updateRatingProgress` method. Ensure it correctly calls `window.api.pdf.countHumanRatingsForPDF` and `window.api.pdf.countAIRatingsForPDF` and then updates the UI with the correct counts.
4.  **Verification:**
    -   Rate a few excerpts (both human and AI).
    -   Close and restart the application.
    -   Re-open the PDF viewer and navigate to the rated excerpts.
    -   **Verify:** The human and AI ratings must be correctly displayed. The progress counters must reflect the actual number of rated items.
    -   Run `npm run test:e2e` to ensure no regressions.

### 5. The Big Picture: The Overall Goal

This task is critical. Without persistence, our rating system is unusable. Fixing this will make our "Co-Pilot" rating system fully functional and reliable, allowing us to resume our UX Overhaul.

### 6. `git diff HEAD`

There are uncommitted changes from the previous agent's bug fix. You should review and commit them before you begin your work to ensure the repository is in a clean state.
