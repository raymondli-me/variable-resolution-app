# Handoff for Agent B: Continue "The Great Refactoring"

**Date:** October 7, 2025
**Author:** Gemini Consultant Agent
**Status:** ðŸŸ¢ **ACTION REQUIRED** - Handoff to Implementation Agent B

---

## Part I: Strategic Context

Agent A has successfully completed the first two major steps of our refactoring sprint, extracting all IPC handlers for Folders, Collections, PDFs, and YouTube. This has been a massive success, dramatically reducing the complexity of `main.js`.

Your task is to continue this critical work by tackling the next major domain: **AI Analysis and Best-Worst Scaling (BWS)**.

## Part II: Handoff to Agent B (Seamless Handoff Protocol)

### 1. Executive Summary of Work Completed

-   Agent A has extracted all data-genre-related IPC handlers into the `src/ipc/` directory.
-   The `main.js` file has been significantly reduced by over 1,600 lines so far.
-   The application is stable and the refactoring pattern is well-established.
-   The last commit was `7ee7908`.

### 2. Current Application State

-   **Does it Run?:** Yes.
-   **Known Bugs:** No known functional bugs. We are continuing our architectural refactoring.
-   **Last Tested Action:** Core functionality for folders and collections was verified after the last refactoring.

### 3. Brain Dump: My Working Context

-   **My Immediate Goal:** To continue the "Great Decomposition" of `main.js` by extracting the AI and BWS handlers.
-   **My Thought Process:** The AI (`ai:...`) and BWS (`bws:...`) handlers represent the largest remaining block of complex, domain-specific logic in `main.js`. They are tightly related to each other but separate from the other handlers. Extracting them is the next logical step before tackling the final, smaller group of miscellaneous handlers.
-   **Relevant Files:** Your work will be in `main.js` and the `src/ipc/` directory.

### 4. Next Immediate, Actionable Task for You (Agent B)

Your task is to continue the IPC handler refactoring for the AI and BWS domains:

1.  Create a new file: `src/ipc/ai-handlers.js`.
2.  Create another new file: `src/ipc/bws-handlers.js`.
3.  **Cut** all `ipcMain.handle('ai:...', ...)` handlers from `main.js` and **paste** them into `ai-handlers.js`.
4.  **Cut** all `ipcMain.handle('bws:...', ...)` handlers from `main.js` and **paste** them into `bws-handlers.js`.
5.  For each of the two new files, add the necessary `require` statements at the top to resolve any dependencies.
6.  In each new file, export a single registration function that accepts the `getDatabase` function as an argument (e.g., `function registerAiHandlers(getDatabase) { ... }` and `function registerBwsHandlers(getDatabase) { ... }`).
7.  In `main.js`, import these two new modules.
8.  In `main.js`, call both new registration functions, passing `getDatabase` to them.
9.  **Verify your work:** Run the application (`npm run dev`). The primary verification for this task is to **ensure the application starts without any errors in the console.** Since the AI/BWS tabs are not fully integrated into our new UI, a simple startup check is sufficient to confirm the refactoring was successful.

### 5. The Big Picture: The Overall Goal

This task will nearly complete the decomposition of `main.js`, leaving only a small number of simple, miscellaneous handlers. This moves us significantly closer to our goal of a clean, modular, and testable core architecture.

### 6. `git diff HEAD`

There are no uncommitted changes. The repository is in a clean state.
