# Handoff: Implement BWS Comparison Set Browser

**Date:** October 8, 2025
**Author:** Gemini Consultant Agent
**Status:** ðŸŸ¢ **ACTION REQUIRED** - Handoff to Next Agent

## Part I: Strategic Context

**The Vision:** The BWS Workspace now displays PDF excerpts within its four quadrants. The next step is to implement the navigation mechanism for comparison sets (tuples), allowing users to browse through the experiment's data.

**The Mission:** Your task is to implement a UI component that allows users to browse through the comparison sets (tuples) of a BWS experiment.

## Part II: Handoff to Agent (Seamless Handoff Protocol)

### 1. Executive Summary of Work Completed

-   The previous agent successfully implemented Ticket #506: Implement Excerpt Display & Controls. The BWS quadrants now display PDF excerpts with highlighting and zoom controls, similar to the main PDF excerpt viewer.

### 2. Current Application State

-   **Does it Run?:** Yes.
-   **Known Bugs:** None.
-   **New Feature:** The BWS Comparison View displays four PDF excerpts with controls.

### 3. Brain Dump: My Working Context

-   **My Immediate Goal:** To implement a UI component that allows users to browse through the comparison sets (tuples) of a BWS experiment.
-   **My Thought Process:** This will likely be a list-style menu, probably on the right-hand side of the BWS workspace. It needs to show the current tuple index, total tuples, and allow navigation (next/previous). It should also provide visual indicators for rated/unrated/AI-rated sets.
-   **Relevant Files:** `src/components/bws-workspace.js` (for rendering and navigation logic), `src/styles/bws-workspace.css` (for styling the browser).

### 4. Next Immediate, Actionable Task

Your task is to implement Comparison Set Browser (Ticket #507):

1.  **UI Component:** Create a new UI component (e.g., a `div` with a list) on the right-hand side of the BWS workspace.
2.  **Navigation Controls:** Implement "Next" and "Previous" buttons to navigate between comparison sets.
3.  **Progress Indicator:** Display the current comparison set index and the total number of comparison sets (e.g., "1 of 100").
4.  **Visual Indicators:** For each comparison set in the list, provide visual indicators (e.g., a small icon or color change) to show if it has been rated (human), AI-rated, or is unrated.
5.  **Integration:** When a new comparison set is selected (either by navigation or direct click), update the four PDF quadrants to display the excerpts from that set.

### 5. Verification

-   Run the app.
-   Open a BWS experiment.
-   Verify that the comparison set browser is displayed, allows navigation, shows progress, and updates the PDF quadrants correctly.

### 6. `git diff HEAD`

There are no uncommitted changes. The working tree is clean. You should start your work on a new branch.
