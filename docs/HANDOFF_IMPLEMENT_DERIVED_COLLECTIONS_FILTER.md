# Handoff: Implement Derived Collections for the "Filter" Action

**Date:** October 7, 2025
**Author:** Gemini Consultant Agent
**Status:** ðŸŸ¢ **ACTION REQUIRED** - Handoff to Next Agent

---

## Part I: Strategic Context

**The Foundation is Laid.** The previous agent successfully updated our database schema to support collection lineage via the `parent_collection_id` and `derivation_info` columns.

**The Mission:** Your task is to be the first to use this new capability. You will refactor the **Filter** action. When a user filters a collection, it will no longer create a disconnected copy; it will create a new, **derived collection** that is formally linked to its parent and stores the filter parameters used.

## Part II: Handoff to Next Agent (Seamless Handoff Protocol)

### 1. Executive Summary of Work Completed

-   The `collections` table in the database now supports lineage tracking.
-   The last commit was `b769d0a`.

### 2. Current Application State

-   **Does it Run?:** Yes. The application is stable.
-   **Known Bugs:** The Filter action creates a new collection but does not link it as a derived child.

### 3. Brain Dump: My Working Context

-   **My Immediate Goal:** To modify the backend logic for the `collections:filter` IPC handler to correctly populate the new `parent_collection_id` and `derivation_info` fields.
-   **My Thought Process:** This is a backend-focused task. The UI for filtering already exists. We just need to change what happens in the service when the new collection is created in the database. This will serve as the pattern for all future enrichment actions (Rating, BWS, etc.).
-   **Relevant Files:** The primary file will be the service or handler that contains the `collections:filter` logic (likely `src/ipc/collection-handlers.js` or a service it calls).

### 4. Next Immediate, Actionable Task

Your task is to refactor the **Filter** action to create a derived collection with lineage:

1.  **Locate the Logic:** Find the backend handler for `collections:filter`.
2.  **Modify the `INSERT` Operation:** When the new, filtered collection is created in the database, you must now also set the values for the two new columns:
    -   Set `parent_collection_id` to the ID of the source collection.
    -   Set `derivation_info` to a JSON string that describes the operation. For example: `JSON.stringify({ method: "filter", parameters: { minViews: 1000, titleKeyword: "AI" } })`.
3.  **Verification:**
    -   Run the application and use the "Filter" action on any collection.
    -   Verify that a new collection is created in the UI.
    -   **Crucially, add a `console.log`** in the `collections-hub.js` `render` method to print the full data for the new collection. Check the application console to see the log and **confirm that the `parent_collection_id` and `derivation_info` fields have been correctly set** for the new collection.
    -   As per our new workflow, run the full E2E test suite (`npm run test:e2e`) to ensure your changes have not caused any regressions.

### 5. The Big Picture: The Overall Goal

This task is the first practical implementation of our "Enrichment Pipeline" vision. By successfully creating a derived collection with traceable lineage, you will establish the core pattern that will be used for all future analysis features, making our application a true research tool.

### 6. `git diff HEAD`

There are no uncommitted changes. The repository is in a clean state.
