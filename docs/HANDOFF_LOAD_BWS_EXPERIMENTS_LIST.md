# Handoff: Load and Display BWS Experiments List

**Date:** October 8, 2025
**Author:** Gemini Consultant Agent
**Status:** ðŸŸ¢ **ACTION REQUIRED** - Handoff to Next Agent

---

## Part I: Strategic Context

**The Vision:** The 'Create BWS Experiment' modal is fully functional, and experiments are being successfully created in the backend. However, these experiments are not yet visible in the 'Experiments List View' of the BWS Workspace.

**The Mission:** Your task is to implement the `loadExperiments()` method in `src/components/bws-workspace.js` to fetch BWS experiments from the database and render them in the 'Experiments List View'.

## Part II: Handoff to Agent (Seamless Handoff Protocol)

### 1. Executive Summary of Work Completed

-   The previous agent successfully debugged and refined the 'Create BWS Experiment' modal, fixing several backend integration issues. BWS experiments are now successfully created in the database.

### 2. Current Application State

-   **Does it Run?:** Yes.
-   **Known Bugs:** Created BWS experiments are not displayed in the "Experiments List View."
-   **New Feature:** BWS experiments can be successfully created via the modal.

### 3. Brain Dump: My Working Context

-   **My Immediate Goal:** To implement the `loadExperiments()` method in `src/components/bws-workspace.js` to fetch BWS experiments from the database and render them in the "Experiments List View."
-   **My Thought Process:** The `loadExperiments()` method currently returns an empty array. It needs to call a backend IPC handler to retrieve the experiments associated with the current collection. The backend already has `db.getBWSExperimentsForCollection()`.
-   **Relevant Files:** `src/components/bws-workspace.js` (for `loadExperiments()` and rendering), `src/ipc/bws-handlers.js` (to expose `getBWSExperimentsForCollection`), `preload.js` (to expose the IPC handler to the frontend).

### 4. Next Immediate, Actionable Task

Your task is to implement `loadExperiments()` to display BWS experiments:

1.  **Expose Backend API:** In `src/ipc/bws-handlers.js`, create an IPC handler (e.g., `bws:getExperimentsForCollection`) that calls `db.getBWSExperimentsForCollection(collectionId)`. Ensure it returns a success/error object.
2.  **Expose to Frontend:** In `preload.js`, expose this new IPC handler to the renderer process (e.g., `window.api.bws.getExperimentsForCollection`).
3.  **Implement `loadExperiments()`:** In `src/components/bws-workspace.js`, modify the `loadExperiments()` method to:
    -   Call `window.api.bws.getExperimentsForCollection(this.state.collectionId)`.
    -   Handle the success/error response.
    -   If successful, update the `this.state.experiments` array with the fetched experiments.
    -   Trigger `this.renderExperimentsList()` to display the fetched experiments.

### 5. Verification

-   Run the app.
-   Navigate to the BWS Workspace for a collection where you've created an experiment.
-   **Verify:** The created BWS experiment should now be displayed as a card in the "Experiments List View."

### 6. `git diff HEAD`

There are uncommitted changes from the previous agent's bug fix. You should review and commit them before you begin your work to ensure the repository is in a clean state.
