## Part II: Handoff to Next Agent (A Multi-Step Task)

This is a large task. Please complete the following steps in order.

### Task 1 (Critical Bug Fix): Fix Horizontal Resizer

-   **The Bug:** The user cannot drag the middle bar to resize the PDF and rating panels.
-   **Action:** Debug the `setupResizers` and `handleHorizontalResize` methods in `pdf-excerpt-viewer.js`. Ensure the `mousemove` event listener correctly updates the panel widths.

### Task 2 (Critical Bug Fix): Fix Clipped Right Panel

-   **The Bug:** Part of the AI rating explanation is clipped off-screen.
-   **Action:** Adjust the CSS in `src/styles/pdf-renderer.css` to ensure the right panel is fully visible and responsive to window size changes.

### Task 3 (Critical Bug Fix): Fix AI Rating Data Disappearing

-   **The Bug:** AI rating data shows up temporarily but then disappears.
-   **Action:** Debug the data loading and rendering logic for the AI Co-Pilot display in `pdf-excerpt-viewer.js`. Ensure the AI rating data is correctly persisted and displayed.

### Task 4 (Bug Fix): Fix "Sticky Highlight" on Off-Click

-   **The Bug:** The green highlight on the excerpt list doesn't clear when clicking off the page.
-   **Action:** Implement logic in `pdf-excerpt-viewer.js` to clear the active highlight in the list when the `highlight:cleared` event is received from the `pdf-highlighter.js`.

### Task 5 (UX Improvement): Implement Higher Zoom Levels

-   **Goal:** Allow the PDF to start at 200% and go up to 400%.
-   **Action:** Modify the `setZoom` method in `pdf-renderer.js` to allow a maximum zoom level of 4.0 (400%).

### Task 6 (UX Improvement): Implement Adjustable Text Size

-   **Goal:** Allow the user to control the font size within the Excerpt Detail Panel.
-   **Action:** Add `+` and `-` buttons to the Excerpt Detail Panel that increase or decrease the `font-size` of the text within that panel.

### Task 7 (UX Improvement): Responsive Layout & Panel Sizing

-   **Goal:** Make the entire PDF viewer UI responsive and adjustable.
-   **Action:** Review the CSS in `src/styles/pdf-renderer.css` and the JavaScript layout logic in `pdf-excerpt-viewer.js`. Ensure all panels (PDF, Excerpt List, Detail Panel) are responsive to window size changes and that their minimum/maximum sizes are well-defined.

### Verification

-   All critical bugs (resizer, clipped panel, disappearing AI data, sticky highlight) must be fixed.
-   The PDF zoom must go up to 400%.
-   The text size in the detail panel must be adjustable.
-   The entire PDF viewer layout must be responsive and functional.
-   Run `npm run test:ui -- --update-snapshots` to save the new state of the UI.
