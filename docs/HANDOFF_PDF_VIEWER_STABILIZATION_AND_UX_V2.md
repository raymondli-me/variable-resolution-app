# Handoff: PDF Viewer Stabilization & UX Refinement (v2)

**Date:** October 7, 2025
**Author:** Gemini Consultant Agent
**Status:** ðŸŸ¢ **ACTION REQUIRED** - Handoff to Next Agent

## Part I: Strategic Context

**Progress Made, But New Bugs Emerge:** The previous agent made significant progress on rating persistence and performance. However, new critical bugs have emerged, and the UI still needs substantial refinement to meet our quality standards.

**The Mission:** Your task is to fix these critical bugs and implement the necessary UX refinements to make the PDF Viewer a truly professional, responsive, and user-friendly tool.

## Part II: Handoff to Next Agent (A Multi-Step Task)

This is a large task. Please complete the following steps in order.

### Task 1 (Critical Bug Fix): Fix `pdfId: null` Error

-   **The Bug:** The PDF viewer is being called with a `null` `pdfId`, causing it to fail to load the PDF. This is a blocking bug.
-   **Action:** Debug the `openPDF` method in `src/components/pdf-gallery-viewer.js` and the `show` method in `src/components/pdf-excerpt-viewer.js`. Ensure that a valid `pdfId` is always passed when opening the PDF viewer.

### Task 2 (Critical Bug Fix): Fix Progress Counters

-   **The Bug:** The progress counters are still showing 0/Total, despite the agent's previous fix. This indicates a problem with how the `updateRatingProgress` method is being called or how it's retrieving the counts.
-   **Action:** Debug the `updateRatingProgress` method in `src/components/pdf-excerpt-viewer.js`. Ensure it correctly retrieves the counts from the database and updates the UI.

### Task 3 (Critical Bug Fix): Fix AI Rating Data Disappearing

-   **The Bug:** AI rating data shows up temporarily but then disappears.
-   **Action:** Debug the data loading and rendering logic for the AI Co-Pilot display in `src/components/pdf-excerpt-viewer.js`. Ensure the AI rating data is correctly persisted and displayed.

### Task 4 (UX Improvement): Implement Vertical Resizer

-   **Goal:** Allow the user to drag the border between the PDF viewer and the bottom Detail Panel to adjust its height.
-   **Action:** Implement a vertical resizer between the PDF viewer and the bottom Detail Panel, allowing the user to drag its border up and down to adjust its height.

### Task 5 (UX Improvement): Implement Adjustable Text Size

-   **Goal:** Allow the user to control the font size within the Excerpt Detail Panel.
-   **Action:** Add `+` and `-` buttons to the Excerpt Detail Panel that increase or decrease the `font-size` of the text within that panel.

### Task 6 (UX Improvement): Responsive Layout & Panel Sizing

-   **Goal:** Make the entire PDF viewer UI responsive and adjustable.
-   **Action:** Review the CSS in `src/styles/pdf-renderer.css` and the JavaScript layout logic in `src/components/pdf-excerpt-viewer.js`. Ensure all panels (PDF, Excerpt List, Detail Panel) are responsive to window size changes and that their minimum/maximum sizes are well-defined.

### Verification

-   All critical bugs (`pdfId: null`, progress counters, disappearing AI data) must be fixed.
-   The Detail Panel must be vertically resizable.
-   The text size in the detail panel must be adjustable.
-   The entire PDF viewer layout must be responsive and functional.
-   Run `npm run test:ui -- --update-snapshots` to save the new UI state.
