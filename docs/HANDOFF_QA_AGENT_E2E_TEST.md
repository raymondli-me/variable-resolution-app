# Handoff: Build the E2E Data Pipeline Test

**Date:** October 7, 2025
**Author:** Gemini Consultant Agent
**Status:** ðŸŸ¢ **ACTION REQUIRED** - Handoff to QA & Testing Agent

## Part I: Strategic Context

**The Application is Ready.** The Implementation Agents have successfully completed all refactoring and feature implementation for the Unified Collections Hub. The application is now 100% feature-complete for all primary operations.

**The Final Mission:** Your task is to build the **Automated End-to-End (E2E) Data Pipeline Test** as outlined in our blueprint. This script will be our ultimate quality gate, ensuring that our entire application workflow functions correctly and looks right, from start to finish.

## Part II: Handoff to QA & Testing Agent (Seamless Handoff Protocol)

### 1. Executive Summary of Work Completed

-   All UI and backend refactoring is complete.
-   The Collections Hub is fully functional.
-   The Playwright framework is installed and configured.

### 2. Current Application State

-   **Does it Run?:** Yes. The application is stable and feature-complete for Phase 1.
-   **Known Bugs:** None.

### 3. Brain Dump: My Working Context

-   **My Immediate Goal:** To create a comprehensive Playwright script that simulates a full user story, from data ingestion to analysis, for both our major data genres (YouTube and PDF).
-   **My Thought Process:** This test will be the culmination of all our work. It will use static test data (fixtures) to be deterministic and will capture screenshots at every key step to provide a complete visual and functional record of the application's state.
-   **Relevant Files:** `package.json`, and new files you will create in the `tests/` directory.

### 4. Next Immediate, Actionable Task

Your task is to create the test fixtures and the Playwright script for our E2E Data Pipeline Test:

1.  **Create Test Fixtures:**
    -   Create a new directory: `tests/fixtures/`.
    -   Inside, create a small, simple, multi-page PDF document named `sample-document.pdf`.
    -   Also inside, create a `sample-youtube-data.json` file containing the raw data for 2-3 sample YouTube videos.

2.  **Create the E2E Test Script:**
    -   Create a new file: `tests/e2e/full-pipeline.spec.js`.
    -   In this file, write a Playwright test that performs the full user story for **both** the YouTube and PDF genres:
        -   **INGEST:** Programmatically import the test fixture file to create a new collection.
        -   **VERIFY:** Navigate to the Hub and take a screenshot to verify the new collection card appears.
        -   **VIEW:** Click the `[View]` button and take a screenshot of the appropriate genre-specific viewer.
        -   **ANALYZE:** Go back, open the context menu, click `[Rate Collection]`, and take a screenshot of the modal.

3.  **Add NPM Script:** In `package.json`, add the script: `"test:e2e": "playwright test tests/e2e/full-pipeline.spec.js"`.

4.  **Verification:**
    -   Run your new test script: `npm run test:e2e`.
    -   Verify that the script completes successfully and that a series of screenshots and a `console-log.txt` file are generated in a new `test-results/` folder.

### 5. The Big Picture: The Overall Goal

Completing this task provides us with an invaluable tool for ensuring the quality and stability of our application. This automated E2E test will be our primary method for regression testing and verifying the success of all future development.

### 6. `git diff HEAD`

There are no uncommitted changes. The repository is in a clean state.
