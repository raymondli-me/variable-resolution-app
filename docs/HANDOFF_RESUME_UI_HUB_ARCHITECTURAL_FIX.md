# Handoff: Resume UI Refactor - Architecturally Align the Hub

**Date:** October 7, 2025
**Author:** Gemini Consultant Agent
**Status:** ðŸŸ¢ **ACTION REQUIRED** - Handoff to Next Agent

---

## Part I: Strategic Context

**We are Unblocked.** The previous agent successfully fixed our database schema. The application's foundation is now solid, and we can confidently resume our primary mission for this phase: **Building the Unified UI Hub**.

**The Next Mission:** Your task is to pick up where we left off. Before we polish the UI, we must make it architecturally correct. You will refactor the Collection Card component to support the future display of "Enrichment Layers."

## Part II: Handoff to Next Agent (Seamless Handoff Protocol)

### 1. Executive Summary of Work Completed

-   A migration script was created and run, fixing all `no such table` database errors.
-   The application is now stable, though some benign race condition errors appear on startup (this is a known, deferred issue).
-   The last commit was `b769d0a`.

### 2. Current Application State

-   **Does it Run?:** Yes.
-   **Known Bugs:** The Collections Hub UI is architecturally incomplete.

### 3. Brain Dump: My Working Context

-   **My Immediate Goal:** To modify the Collection Card component so that its data model and HTML structure have a designated place for future content (ratings, BWS results, etc.).
-   **My Thought Process:** The current card shows basic info. It needs a new section where we *will* eventually list the "Enrichment Layers." For this task, we will simply add a placeholder for that section to prepare the component for future features.
-   **Relevant Files:** `src/components/collections-hub.js` and `src/styles/collections-hub.css`.

### 4. Next Immediate, Actionable Task

Your task is to make the Collection Card component architecturally correct:

1.  **Modify the Component:** In `src/components/collections-hub.js`, locate the `render` method where the card HTML is generated.
2.  **Add the Enrichment Section:** Add a new `div` to the card's structure, below the main body but above the footer. This `div` will be for "Enrichment Layers." Give it a class name like `card-enrichments`.
3.  **Add Placeholder Content:** Inside this new section, add a simple placeholder to indicate its purpose. For example:
    ```html
    <div class="card-enrichments">
      <span>Enrichments: 0</span>
    </div>
    ```
4.  **Add Basic Styling:** In `src/styles/collections-hub.css`, add some basic styling for the `.card-enrichments` class to ensure it looks clean (e.g., some padding, a top border, a different background color).
5.  **Verification (Using our Automated Test):**
    -   Run the UI test suite: `npm run test:ui`.
    -   The test will fail due to a screenshot mismatch. **This is expected.**
    -   Update the baseline screenshot to accept your intentional change by running: `npm run test:ui -- --update-snapshots`.
    -   Run `npm run test:ui` one last time. It must now pass. This successful test run is your proof that the work is complete and visually correct.

### 5. The Big Picture: The Overall Goal

This task ensures our central UI component is correctly structured before we invest time in polishing its appearance. By using our testing framework to verify the change, you are reinforcing the robust, agent-driven QA process that is critical to our success.

### 6. `git diff HEAD`

There are no uncommitted changes. The repository is in a clean state.
