# Handoff: Final Modernization - BWS Service

**Date:** October 7, 2025
**Author:** Gemini Consultant Agent
**Status:** ðŸŸ¢ **ACTION REQUIRED** - Handoff to Next Agent

---

## Part I: Strategic Context

**The Finish Line for Step 2 is in Sight.** The team has successfully modernized both the YouTube Collector and the AI Rater services. Only one major legacy component remains before our entire backend architecture is up to a professional standard.

**The Final Mission:** Your task is to apply our proven refactoring pattern to the final "Red Zone" component: the **Best-Worst Scaling (BWS) Service**.

## Part II: Handoff to Next Agent (Seamless Handoff Protocol)

### 1. Executive Summary of Work Completed

-   The previous agent successfully refactored the AI Rating service into the new `src/services/ai-rater-service.js` class.
-   The `ai-handlers.js` file is now a thin, clean wrapper.
-   The last commit was `df875ed`.

### 2. Current Application State

-   **Does it Run?:** Yes. The application is stable.
-   **Known Bugs:** No known functional bugs.

### 3. Brain Dump: My Working Context

-   **My Immediate Goal:** To complete Step 2 of "The Great Refactoring" by modernizing the final core service, BWS.
-   **My Thought Process:** The `bws-handlers.js` file contains all the logic for creating, running, and analyzing BWS experiments. Encapsulating this logic in a class is the final step to having a fully modularized and maintainable backend architecture.
-   **Relevant Files:** Your work will be in `src/ipc/bws-handlers.js` and a new file you will create, `src/services/bws-service.js`.

### 4. Next Immediate, Actionable Task

Your task is to refactor the `bws-handlers.js` module into a modern, class-based service:

1.  Create a new file: `src/services/bws-service.js`.
2.  Inside this new file, define and export a `BwsService` class.
3.  Move all the logic from `src/ipc/bws-handlers.js` into methods within this new `BwsService` class (e.g., `createExperiment()`, `getNextTuple()`, `calculateScores()`, etc.).
4.  The class `constructor` should accept its dependencies (e.g., `getDatabase`).
5.  Integrate the **toast notification system** for key user-facing actions like creating an experiment, calculating scores, or when an error occurs.
6.  Update `src/ipc/bws-handlers.js` to be a **thin wrapper**. Its registration function will simply create an instance of your new `BwsService` and have the IPC handlers call the corresponding methods on that instance.
7.  **Verification:** Run the app (`npm run dev`). The only verification required for this architectural task is to **ensure the application starts without any errors in the console.**

### 5. The Big Picture: The Overall Goal

Completing this task will officially mark the end of **Step 2: Modernizing the Core Services**. At that point, our entire backend logic, from data collection to AI analysis, will be encapsulated in robust, modern, and maintainable services. This is a massive strategic victory for the project.

### 6. `git diff HEAD`

There are no uncommitted changes. The repository is in a clean state.
