## 1. A New Era for the Application

This document marks the successful completion of our entire strategic initiative, **"The Great Refactoring."** Over the past day, the team has executed a complex, multi-phase architectural overhaul of the application, culminating in the launch of the new, **Unified Collections Hub**.

Our goal was to transform the application from a brittle prototype with a confusing UI into a stable, scalable, and intuitive professional-grade tool. **That goal has been achieved.**

-   ✅ **Step 1 (Decomposition):** The `main.js` monolith was successfully dismantled.
-   ✅ **Step 2 (Modernization):** All core backend services were refactored into robust, modern classes.
-   ✅ **Step 3 (Unification):** The UI was completely rebuilt around our "Collections-First" architecture.

## 2. The Final Piece: A Fully Functional Hub

The last agent session completed the final step by implementing the `Export`, `Duplicate`, and `Delete` actions. The Collections Hub is now **100% feature-complete** for all primary collection operations. Users can now, from a single, intuitive interface:

-   **View** collections in their genre-specific viewers.
-   **Initiate** complex analysis like AI Rating and BWS.
-   **Manage** collections with essential utilities like Export, Duplicate, and Delete.

## 3. The Final Gate: User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

The application is now in the state we've been working towards. It is stable, modern, and architecturally sound. Before we close this chapter and plan new features, one final step remains.

### Your Task, as Project Lead:

> **Please execute the full test plan as laid out in `docs/INTEGRATION_TEST_PLAN_PHASE_0.md`.**

Note that while the test cases in the plan are still valid, the **entry points** for those actions have now changed to the context menu on the collection cards, reflecting our successful refactoring.

Your successful completion of this test plan will be the final sign-off on this entire body of work and will certify the application as ready for the next phase of development.

Congratulations to the entire team on this outstanding achievement. We have built a rock-solid foundation for the future.
