## 2. Review of BUG-002: `prompt()` Replacement

- **Bug:** The application crashed when creating/renaming/deleting folders because it used the browser's native `prompt()` and `confirm()` functions, which are disabled in Electron.
- **Analysis of Fix:** Agent B implemented a superior solution. Instead of creating a one-off fix, they engineered two new reusable, promise-based helper functions:
    - `showPromptModal()`: A professional-looking modal for text input.
    - `showConfirmModal()`: A clean, safe confirmation dialog.
- **Assessment:** This is an excellent, forward-thinking solution. These helper functions are now a valuable asset that can be used anywhere else in the application, ensuring a consistent user experience. The implementation is high-quality, complete with keyboard support and proper styling.

## 3. Review of BUG-003: Race Condition / `undefined` Errors

- **Bug:** The UI was attempting to render data before it was loaded, leading to crashes and visual artifacts like `NaN`.
- **Analysis of Fix:** Agent B has hardened the UI by adding defensive guards and default values in numerous locations. The code now anticipates the possibility of data being `null` or `undefined` during the render cycle and handles it gracefully.
- **Assessment:** The fix is thorough and directly addresses the root cause of the instability. By adding these checks to the rendering loops, data filters, and event handlers, the entire frontend is now significantly more stable and resilient.
