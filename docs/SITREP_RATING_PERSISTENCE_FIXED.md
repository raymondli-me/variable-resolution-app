## Part I: Mission Accomplished - Rating System is Now Reliable

This report confirms the successful resolution of the critical rating persistence bug. The "Co-Pilot" rating system is now fully functional and reliable.

-   **The Root Cause:** The bug was a subtle but critical parameter naming mismatch between the frontend (snake_case) and backend (camelCase) for the rating-related IPC handlers. This caused all parameter values to be `undefined`, preventing data from being loaded or saved correctly.

-   **The Fix:** The agent correctly updated all rating-related IPC handlers in `src/ipc/pdf-handlers.js` to use snake_case parameter destructuring, matching the frontend's expectations. Additionally, logic was added to `pdf-excerpt-viewer.js` to ensure existing AI ratings are loaded from the database before generating new ones.

-   **The Impact:**
    -   ✅ Human ratings (score and notes) now persist across app restarts and navigation.
    -   ✅ AI ratings (score and reasoning) now persist and load correctly.
    -   ✅ Progress counters now accurately reflect the number of human and AI-rated excerpts.

## Part II: Current Application State

-   **Stability:** The application is now stable and the "Co-Pilot" rating system is fully functional and reliable.
-   **Hardening Sprint:** The Hardening Sprint is complete. All critical bugs identified in the `FINAL_SITREP_AND_RECOVERY_PLAN.md` have been addressed.

## Part III: What Now?

We are now ready to resume **Phase 2: The UX Overhaul**.

I await your next set of issues or feature requests to formulate the next handoff. The application is stable, and we can now confidently build new features and refine the user experience.
