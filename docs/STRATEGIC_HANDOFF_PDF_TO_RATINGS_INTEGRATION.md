## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines the next major phase of our project: **integrating the AI Rating services with our new, powerful PDF Viewer.**

The previous phase, the creation of the PDF Visual Viewer, is now **100% complete**. The implementation agents have delivered a stable, feature-rich foundation for viewing and interacting with PDF documents, as detailed in their final report (`docs/FINAL_HANDOFF_PDF_VISUAL_VIEWER_COMPLETE.md`).

We are now pivoting, as planned, to connect this best-in-class frontend component to our core AI services. The goal of this phase is to create a seamless `PDF -> Ratings -> View` pipeline, fulfilling a key part of the application's vision.

## 2. Updated Codebase Map & Strategic Context

The recent work has significantly advanced our PDF handling capabilities. Here is the updated map:

-   **ðŸŸ¢ Green Zone (Strength):**
    -   **Collection & Folder Management:** The stable bedrock of the app.
    -   **Advanced PDF Handling (v1):** Now a major asset. Includes sentence-level chunking with bounding box data, and a robust canvas-based renderer with highlighting.

-   **ðŸŸ¡ Yellow Zone (Needs Attention):**
    -   **Core Logic (`main.js`, `renderer-advanced.js`):** The PDF viewer has added complexity here. The need to refactor these large files is growing more critical.

-   **ðŸ”´ Red Zone (Our Current Focus):**
    -   **AI Rating & BWS Services (`gemini-rater.js`, `bws-tuple-generator.js`):** This is where our work begins. These services are functional but outdated. They are not aware of our new PDF data structures and do not integrate with the new viewer.

**The Bridge:** The work of this new phase is to build the bridge from our Green Zone (the PDF Viewer) to our Red Zone (the Rating Services), bringing the rating services up to modern standards in the process.

## 3. The Vision: A Ratings-Aware PDF Viewer

This phase will evolve the PDF viewer from a simple document renderer into a powerful data visualization tool. The end goal is a **unified viewer** that intelligently displays rating data on top of the PDF content.

### Feature 1: Enhanced Viewer Interactivity

-   **Scrollable PDF:** The current viewer is page-based. It must be enhanced to support smooth, continuous scrolling through the entire PDF document.
-   **Bi-Directional Linking:**
    1.  Clicking an excerpt in the right-hand list should smoothly scroll the PDF view to that sentence's location.
    2.  Clicking a highlighted sentence within the PDF canvas should, in turn, scroll the right-hand list to that corresponding excerpt.

### Feature 2: Ratings Data Visualization

The viewer must be refactored to handle a "rated collection" (a derived collection that includes rating metadata) and visualize the data effectively.

-   **Display Scores:** The excerpt list should be updated to display the relevance score next to each item.
-   **Color-Coded Highlights:** The highlight colors on the PDF canvas should change based on the rating score (e.g., bright green for highly relevant, red for irrelevant).
-   **Informative Tooltips:** Hovering the mouse over a highlighted sentence in the PDF should display a tooltip containing the rating score, confidence, and Gemini's reasoning.

## 4. Technical Handoff for the Next Agent

-   **Starting Point:** Your work begins from the state described in `docs/FINAL_HANDOFF_PDF_VISUAL_VIEWER_COMPLETE.md`. Study this document carefully.
-   **Key Files to Modify:** `src/components/pdf-excerpt-viewer.js`, `src/components/pdf-renderer.js`, `src/components/pdf-highlighter.js`, and `src/services/gemini-rater.js`.

-   **First Immediate Task: Refactor the AI Rating Service**
    -   **Goal:** Before you can display ratings, the rating service must be able to generate them for PDFs.
    -   **Action:** Your first task is to modify `src/services/gemini-rater.js`. It currently has methods for rating video chunks and comments. You must add a new method, `ratePDFExcerpt(excerptText, pdfContext, researchIntent, ratingScale)`, that takes the text of a PDF excerpt and returns a rating object. You can use the existing `rateComment` method as a template for the API call structure.

## 5. Living Documentation: Quirks, Mistakes & Pro-Tips

This section is mandatory reading. It is our collective memory of lessons learned.

### Pro-Tip: The "Derived Collection" Philosophy

When implementing the ratings integration, you **must** adhere to our core architectural principle: **Do not modify the original collection.**

The AI Rating Service should consume a collection of PDF excerpts and produce a **new, derived collection**. This new collection will contain all the original excerpts, but now with additional metadata (the rating scores, reasoning, etc.). The PDF Viewer will then be updated to render this new, enriched collection type. This ensures our data flow remains traceable and immutable.

### Common Mistakes & Quirks (from previous phases)

-   **`prompt()` is forbidden in Electron.** Always build custom modals for user input. Use the helpers in `folder-browser.js` as a template.
-   **The `service_worker_storage.cc` error is benign.** It can be safely ignored.
-   **Guard against race conditions.** UI rendering code must always check if asynchronous data has arrived before attempting to use it. Use default fallbacks (e.g., `collection.count || 0`) to prevent `NaN` errors.
-   **Backend services must validate their inputs.** Never trust data from the frontend. The `CollectionImporter` is the canonical example of how to do this correctly.
-   **Tooling requires absolute file paths.** Always construct the full absolute path for file system operations.
-   **PDF.js coordinate systems are flipped.** The PDF canvas has its origin at the bottom-left. You must flip the Y-axis when converting to the top-left origin of an HTML canvas.

## 6. Conclusion

This phase is exciting. It connects two major components of our application and begins to pay down our strategic technical debt in the core AI services. By the end of this phase, we will have a truly powerful and unique tool for visually analyzing rated PDF content.

This plan is now assigned to the **Next Implementation Agent** to begin execution.
