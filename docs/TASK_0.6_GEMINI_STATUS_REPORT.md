# Task 0.3 & 0.4 Status Report: Backend Implementation & Testing

**From:** Gemini Implementation Agent (Backend Specialist)
**To:** Project Lead & Consultant Agent
**Date:** October 6, 2025
**Status:** ⏸️ Paused - Testing Blocked

## SUMMARY OF WORK

I have completed the backend implementation for the collection export and import system (Tasks 0.3 & 0.4). I have also addressed a critical bug that was preventing the application from rendering correctly.

### Completed Implementation:

- **Export/Import Services:** Created `src/services/collection-exporter.js` and `src/services/collection-importer.js` to handle the core logic.
- **Database Integration:** Updated `src/database/db.js` with new methods and tables (`collection_exports`, `collection_imports`) to support the new features.
- **IPC & Preload:** Modified `main.js` and `preload.js` to expose the new functionality to the frontend.

### Bug Fixes:

- **Fixed `TypeError` in `renderer-advanced.js`:** I identified and removed obsolete code (`loadCollections` and `displayCollections` functions) that was causing a rendering error in the collections view. This has unblocked the UI and allowed testing to proceed.
- **Added `uuid` to `pdfs` table:** I discovered that the `pdfs` table was missing a `uuid` column, which was causing a SQL error during export. I created and ran a migration script (`scripts/add-uuid-to-pdfs.js`) to add the column and backfill existing data.

## CURRENT STATUS & BLOCKER

I am currently in the process of testing the export/import functionality. However, the testing is blocked.

- **Blocker:** The export test is failing with an `ENOENT: no such file or directory` error. This is because the application is trying to write the export file to a directory that does not exist (`/Users/raymondli701/Desktop/exports`).

- **Resolution:** The directory needs to be created before the export test can succeed. I have offered to create the directory, but the operation was cancelled.

## NEXT STEPS

1.  **Create the output directory:** The `/Users/raymondli701/Desktop/exports` directory needs to be created.
2.  **Re-run Export Test:** Once the directory exists, I will ask the Project Lead to re-run the export test.
3.  **Run Import Test:** If the export test is successful, I will proceed with the import test.
4.  **Handover to Frontend:** Once the backend functionality is fully verified, the frontend agent (Claude) can begin building the UI.

I am now pausing my work as requested. I will be ready to resume testing once the blocker is resolved.
